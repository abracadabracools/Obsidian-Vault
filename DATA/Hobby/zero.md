there is a cupola at the t junction at the bust stop, its the central point of the community. there are shops and fare autos . the two shops one side by side of canara bank and one opposite to it is where i go and purchase goods.

towards the main road to aluva there is a fish shop  and barber shop which i visit. a petrol pumb opposite, badminton court inside it. i used to play in the court for some time. it was not  a relaxing community affair as such so i stopped.

its a calm place to be. A place where i stayed ! Chunagamvely !!
