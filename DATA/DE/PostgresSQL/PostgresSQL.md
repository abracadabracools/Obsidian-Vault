### 🧠 What is PostgreSQL?

**PostgreSQL (Postgres)** is a powerful, open-source **relational database management system (RDBMS)**.  
It’s basically a system that:

- 📦 **Stores** structured data in tables (like Excel, but way more powerful)
    
- 🔍 **Lets you query** that data with SQL
    
- 🔧 **Enforces rules** on data integrity
    
- ⚙️ **Performs computations, joins, filtering, aggregations**, and much more
    

It’s one of the most widely used databases in data engineering, analytics, backend systems, and machine learning pipelines.
